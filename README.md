# Automate Everything: A Productivity and Efficiency Toolbox

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I've compiled a diverse range of tools and automation scripts to supercharge your daily tasks and transform your workflow. Whether you want to streamline your file management, optimize GIF compression, convert PNG files to WEBP, or even create outlines for geographic states using coordinates, this repository is your one-stop destination for enhanced productivity.

## Why Should You Automate Your Life?

Your time is a valuable resource, and it should be dedicated to creating remarkable things. That's why automation is the key:

- **Focus on the Extraordinary**: Stop being bogged down by repetitive, mundane tasks. Instead, focus on what truly matters by automating the routine.

- **End the Repetition**: Performing the same tasks over and over is not only monotonous but also a massive time-waster. Automation eliminates this redundancy.

- **Automate for Life**: Automation isn't just a one-time solution; it's a philosophy for a more efficient, productive life. It's about having your computer do more while you do less.

## What's in This Repository?

This repository is a dynamic collection of scripts and tools that will assist you in various aspects of your daily life:

- **File Automation**: Say goodbye to manual file sorting and organization. Let scripts handle your downloads folder and more.

- **GIF Compression**: Optimize the size and quality of GIFs effortlessly.

- **PNG to WEBP Conversion**: Convert PNG images to the efficient and web-friendly WEBP format with ease.

- **Geographic State Outlines**: Create geographic state outlines using coordinates, perfect for cartography and geospatial projects.

- **GitHub Repo Time Tracking**: Keep track of your project time, ensuring you stay on top of your commitments.

This repository is your gateway to a more efficient, automated daily routine. Feel free to explore, utilize, and contribute. Join the journey to automate your life and save time for the things that truly matter.

After all, why should you do more when your computer can do more for you?

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Setting Up Python on Mac

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your Mac. Follow these steps to set up Python:

1. **Check if Python is Installed:** Open your terminal and run the following command to check if Python is already installed:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

    If Python is installed, you'll see the version number. If not, proceed to the next step.

2. **Install Homebrew (optional but recommended):** If you don't have Homebrew installed, it's a package manager that makes it easier to manage software on your Mac. You can install Homebrew by running this command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

3. **Install Python:** Use Homebrew to install Python. This will ensure you get the latest version and manage it easily. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    brew install python
    ```

4. **Verify Python Installation:** After the installation is complete, run the following command to verify that Python is correctly installed:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

    You should now see the version number of Python.

Now, you have Python set up on your Mac, and you're ready to proceed with the project. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please refer to the official Python documentation or seek help online.

**Note:** It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate dependencies. You can use `venv` or a package like `virtualenv` to manage virtual environments.

<!-- Running the Scripts -->
## Running the Scripts

To run the scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):** 
   - Use the following command to create a virtual environment. Replace `myenv` with your preferred environment name.

     ```bash
     python -m venv myenv
     ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - Activate the virtual environment to isolate project-specific dependencies.

     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

   You'll see the environment name in your terminal prompt when it's activated.

3. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**
   - When you're done, deactivate the virtual environment using:

     ```bash
     deactivate
     ```

4. **Navigate to the Script Folder:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder containing the script you want to run. For example:

     ```bash
     cd path/to/script-folder
     ```

5. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the Python script with:

     ```bash
     python <filename>
     ```

   Replace `<filename>` with the actual script name.

You're now ready to run the scripts within your virtual environment. Activate the environment whenever you work on your project to ensure proper dependency isolation. Explore the various scripts and tools in this repository to streamline your tasks effectively.
